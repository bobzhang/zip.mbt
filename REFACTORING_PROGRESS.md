# Package Refactoring Progress

## Overview
Following the architecture plan in ARCHITECTURE.md, we are extracting packages from the monolithic zip.mbt file into separate, independently testable packages organized by dependency levels.

## Completed Packages (5 total)

### Level 0: Leaf Nodes (Zero Dependencies) - 2 packages
1. **checksum/crc32** âœ…
   - Lines: ~100
   - Tests: 7/7 passing
   - Exports: `Crc32` struct, `bytes_crc32()` (removed `check_crc32()`)
   - Status: Production-ready

2. **checksum/adler32** âœ…
   - Lines: ~110
   - Tests: 6/6 passing
   - Exports: `Adler32` struct, `bytes_adler32()` (removed `check_adler32()`)
   - Status: Production-ready

### Level 1: Basic Utilities - 2 packages

  - checksum/crc32: 7 tests
  - checksum/adler32: 6 tests
  - buffer: 5 tests
  - bitstream: 5 tests
  - hexdump: 3 tests
  - Main package (zip): 169 tests
  
## Dependency Graph (Current State)
```
Level 0 (Leaf):
  - checksum/crc32    [0 deps]
  - checksum/adler32  [0 deps]
  - buffer            [0 deps]
  - hexdump           [0 deps]

Level 1 (Basic Utilities):
  - bitstream         [1 dep: buffer]

Level ?: (Not yet extracted):
  - Main zip package (3,524 lines remaining)
```

## Next Steps (Per ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Remaining Level 1 Packages
None - both Level 1 packages complete!

### Level 2: Data Format Packages (4 packages)
1. **types/compression** (~50 lines, 2 tests)

   - Dependencies: None

3. **types/fpath** (~100 lines, 8 tests)
   - Filepath sanitization and normalization
   - Currently in zip.mbt lines 203-246
   - Dependencies: None

4. **types/member** (~200 lines, 10 tests)
   - `Member`, `MemberKind`, `File` types
   - Archive member metadata
   - Dependencies: compression, ptime, fpath
   - Currently scattered across zip.mbt

### Level 3: Codec Packages (2 packages)
5. **codec/huffman** (~400 lines, 15 tests)
   - `HuffmanEncoder`, `HuffmanDecoder`
   - Symbol encoding/decoding
   - Dependencies: None

6. **codec/lz77** (~200 lines, 8 tests)
   - LZ77 back-reference matching

   - Dependencies: buffer

### Level 4: Compression Packages (2 packages)
7. **deflate/decoder** (~300 lines, 10 tests)
   - `InflateDecoder` and inflate functions
   - Dependencies: buffer, huffman

8. **deflate/encoder** (~600 lines, 12 tests)
   - DEFLATE compression (fixed, dynamic, stored)
   - Dependencies: buffer, bitstream, huffman, lz77

### Level 5: Format Packages (1 package)
9. **format/zip** (~800 lines, 20 tests)
   - ZIP file format reading/writing
   - Central directory, local headers
   - Dependencies: member, compression, checksum/crc32

### Level 6: High-Level API (1 package)
10. **archive** (~600 lines, 30 tests)
    - `Archive` type with high-level operations
    - Dependencies: format/zip, deflate/encoder, deflate/decoder, member

## Migration Strategy
1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Extract Level 0 leaf packages (checksum/crc32, checksum/adler32)
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Extract Level 1 utilities (buffer, bitstream)
3. **Phase 3**: Extract Level 2 type packages (compression, ptime, fpath, member)
4. **Phase 4**: Extract Level 3 codec packages (huffman, lz77)
5. **Phase 5**: Extract Level 4 compression packages (deflate/decoder, deflate/encoder)
6. **Phase 6**: Extract Level 5 format package (format/zip)
7. **Phase 7**: Extract Level 6 API package (archive)

## Metrics

### Code Size Reduction
- **Before**: 3,702 lines in zip.mbt
- **After Level 0-1**: ~3,524 lines remaining (178 lines extracted)
- **Target**: ~17 packages with clear boundaries

### Test Coverage
- All extracted packages: 100% test pass rate
- Tests moved with implementation to maintain coverage
- No test regressions during refactoring

### Warnings
- Current: 16 warnings (unused variables, reserved words)
- These will be addressed as packages are extracted
- Zero errors in all builds

## Benefits Achieved So Far
1. âœ… **Modularity**: 5 independent packages created
2. âœ… **Testability**: Each package has isolated tests
3. âœ… **Reusability**: CRC32, Adler32, ByteBuf, BitWriter can be used independently
4. âœ… **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between concerns
5. âœ… **Zero Regressions**: All 195 tests still passing

## Commits Made
1. `a1e5223` - Extract CRC32 and Adler32 into checksum packages
2. `cf7d700` - Add comprehensive test failure analysis
3. `0c1c7a8` - Update all 20 test expectations after UTF-8 fixes
4. `a157f5b` - Extract ByteBuf into buffer package
5. `a2c940e` - Extract BitWriter into bitstream package

## Current Status
- âœ… Level 0 complete (4 packages: crc32, adler32, buffer, hexdump)
- âœ… Level 1 complete (1 package: bitstream)
- ðŸš§ Next: Level 2 (types/compression, types/ptime, types/fpath, types/member)
- Total progress: **5 of 17 packages** (29.4%)
- Lines extracted: **~350 of 3,702** (9.5%)
- Tests: **195/195 passing** (100%)
