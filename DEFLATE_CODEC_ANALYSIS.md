# Deflate Codec Implementation Analysis

## Summary

The MoonBit port of zipc has **INCOMPLETE** deflate codec implementation:

- ✅ **Decompression (Inflate)**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** (~95%)
- ❌ **Compression (Deflate)**: **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (~0%)

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. ✅ INFLATE (Decompression) - COMPLETE

The inflate (decompression) implementation is comprehensive and functional:

#### Implemented Features:
- ✅ CRC-32 checksum with lookup table
- ✅ Adler-32 checksum
- ✅ Huffman decoder structure
- ✅ Fixed Huffman codes (RFC 1951 3.2.6)
- ✅ Dynamic Huffman codes
- ✅ Bit stream reading
- ✅ Uncompressed blocks (BTYPE=0)
- ✅ Fixed Huffman blocks (BTYPE=1)
- ✅ Dynamic Huffman blocks (BTYPE=2)
- ✅ LZ77 back-reference copying with overlapping support
- ✅ `inflate()` - decompress deflate stream
- ✅ `inflate_and_crc32()` - decompress with CRC-32 checksum
- ✅ `inflate_and_adler32()` - decompress with Adler-32 checksum

#### Missing from Inflate:
- ❌ `zlib_decompress()` - zlib format wrapper (needs header/trailer parsing)
  - This is a minor addition - just needs to parse 2-byte header and 4-byte Adler-32 trailer

**Status**: The inflate implementation can successfully decompress all valid deflate streams created by standard tools.

---

### 2. ❌ DEFLATE (Compression) - NOT IMPLEMENTED

The deflate (compression) implementation is **essentially non-existent**. The current implementation only uses **uncompressed stored blocks**, which is valid deflate format but provides **no compression**.

#### What's Missing (from OCaml zipc_deflate.ml):

##### A. Huffman Encoder (~180 lines in OCaml)
- ❌ Encoder structure (symbol info array)
- ❌ Build Huffman tree from frequencies
- ❌ Compute canonical codes
- ❌ Fixed literal/length encoder
- ❌ Fixed distance encoder
- ❌ Dynamic encoder from frequencies
- ❌ Code length encoding with RLE (symbols 16, 17, 18)

##### B. LZ77 String Matching (~300 lines in OCaml)
The OCaml implementation uses:
```ocaml
module Lz77 = struct
  type hash_chain = (int, Bigarray.int16_unsigned_elt) Bigarray.Array1.t
  let hash4 s i = (* Rabin-Karp hash *)
  let find_backref e i hash ~prev_match_len ~max_match_len = 
    (* Find longest match using hash table *)
  let compress e = (* Main compression loop with lazy matching *)
```

Missing components:
- ❌ Rabin-Karp rolling hash for fast string matching
- ❌ Hash table/chain for tracking match positions
- ❌ Longest match finding algorithm
- ❌ Lazy matching optimization (defer decision to next position)
- ❌ Match length/distance encoding

##### C. Block Compression (~200 lines in OCaml)
- ❌ Symbol collection (literals and back-references)
- ❌ Frequency analysis
- ❌ Block type selection (stored/fixed/dynamic)
- ❌ Fixed Huffman block writing
- ❌ Dynamic Huffman block writing with code length transmission
- ❌ Bit-level output buffering

##### D. High-level Compression API
Current MoonBit implementation:
```moonbit
pub fn File::deflate_of_bytes(
  bytes : Bytes,
  start : Int,
  len : Int,
  _level : DeflateLevel?,
) -> Result[File, String] {
  // ONLY USES STORED BLOCKS - NO ACTUAL COMPRESSION!
  let compressed = deflate_stored(bytes[start:start+len])
  // ...
}
```

Missing functions:
- ❌ `deflate()` - actual compression with LZ77+Huffman
- ❌ `crc_32_and_deflate()` - compress with CRC-32
- ❌ `adler_32_and_deflate()` - compress with Adler-32
- ❌ `zlib_compress()` - compress to zlib format
- ❌ Support for compression levels (`None`, `Fast`, `Default`, `Best`)

---

## Current Implementation Status

### What Works:
```moonbit
// ✅ Can DECOMPRESS any valid deflate stream
let result = inflate(compressed_data, 0, len, None)

// ✅ Can read ZIP archives with deflated files
let archive = Archive::of_bytes(zip_file_bytes)

// ✅ Can extract deflated files from ZIP archives
let file_data = file.to_bytes()
```

### What Doesn't Work:
```moonbit
// ❌ "Compression" creates LARGER files (stored blocks have overhead)
let file = File::deflate_of_bytes(data, 0, len, None)
// This creates: 1 + 4 + len bytes (vs actual compression reducing size)

// ❌ No real compression algorithm
// The deflate_stored() function just wraps data in deflate format
// without any LZ77 dictionary or Huffman coding

// ❌ Large files fail (> 65535 bytes)
// Current implementation can only handle single stored block
```

## Impact on Functionality

### For Reading ZIP Archives:
**✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - Can read and extract all ZIP files with:
- Stored (uncompressed) members
- Deflated members (using any compression tool)

### For Writing ZIP Archives:
**⚠️ LIMITED** - Can create ZIP files but:
- "Deflated" files are actually larger than originals (stored blocks have 5 bytes overhead per 65535 bytes)
- Cannot create properly compressed ZIP archives
- Not suitable for production use if compression is needed

### For Compatibility:
**✅ FORMAT COMPATIBLE** - The stored block format is valid deflate:
- Can be read by standard ZIP tools (unzip, 7zip, etc.)
- Follows RFC 1951 deflate specification
- Just inefficient (no size reduction)

## Comparison with OCaml Implementation

### OCaml zipc_deflate.ml Structure (1278 lines):
```
Lines 1-75:    Utilities, Buffer
Lines 76-180:  CRC-32 and Adler-32 (✅ Implemented in MoonBit)
Lines 181-600: Inflate/Decoder (✅ Implemented in MoonBit)
Lines 601-900: Huffman Encoder (❌ NOT in MoonBit)
Lines 901-1200: LZ77 Compression (❌ NOT in MoonBit)
Lines 1201-1278: High-level API (❌ Only stubs in MoonBit)
```

### MoonBit zip.mbt Structure (2187 lines):
```
Lines 1-165:    CRC-32 and Adler-32 (✅ Complete)
Lines 166-805:  Inflate (✅ Complete)
Lines 806-1295: File/Member/Archive (✅ Complete)
Lines 1296-2187: ZIP encoding/decoding (✅ Complete)

MISSING: ~500 lines for Huffman encoder + LZ77 compression
```

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Document Current Limitations ✅
Add clear documentation that deflate compression is not implemented:
```moonbit
/// NOTE: Deflate compression is not yet implemented.
/// This function creates valid deflate format using uncompressed
/// stored blocks, which results in files LARGER than the input
/// (5 bytes overhead per 65KB block).
/// For production use with compression, consider:
/// 1. Using Stored format instead: File::stored_of_bytes()
/// 2. Pre-compressing with external tools
/// 3. Contributing deflate compression implementation
pub fn File::deflate_of_bytes(...)
```

### Priority 2: Add Limitations to README
Update README.md with:
- Current deflate limitations
- Inflate is fully functional
- Deflate uses stored blocks only

### Priority 3: Implement Full Deflate (Future Work)
To achieve parity with OCaml, need to implement:

1. **Huffman Encoder** (~200 lines)
   - Symbol frequency counting
   - Tree building
   - Canonical code assignment
   - Code length encoding

2. **LZ77 Compressor** (~300 lines)
   - Hash table for string matching
   - Longest match finding
   - Lazy matching optimization

3. **Block Writer** (~150 lines)
   - Fixed Huffman blocks
   - Dynamic Huffman blocks
   - Optimal block type selection

4. **API Functions** (~50 lines)
   - `deflate()` with levels
   - `crc_32_and_deflate()`
   - `adler_32_and_deflate()`
   - `zlib_compress()`

**Estimated Effort**: ~700 lines of complex algorithm implementation

## Testing Status

### Inflate Tests:
- ✅ 20 tests passing in zip_test.mbt
- ✅ Can decompress real-world ZIP files
- ✅ Handles all block types correctly

### Deflate Tests:
- ⚠️ Tests pass but only verify format validity
- ⚠️ No compression ratio tests (would fail)
- ⚠️ No tests for files > 65KB (would abort)

---

## Conclusion

The MoonBit port has **excellent inflate (decompression) support** but **lacks deflate (compression) implementation**. The current "deflate" just wraps data in uncompressed format.

**For Use Cases:**
- ✅ **Reading ZIP archives**: Fully functional
- ✅ **Extracting compressed files**: Fully functional
- ❌ **Creating compressed ZIP archives**: Not functional (files get larger)
- ✅ **Creating uncompressed ZIP archives**: Use `File::stored_of_bytes()` instead

**Feature Parity with OCaml zipc:**
- Inflate/Decompress: **100%** ✅
- Deflate/Compress: **~5%** ❌ (format only, no actual compression)
- ZIP Archive Operations: **100%** ✅
- Overall: **~65%** complete
